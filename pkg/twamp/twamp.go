package twamp

/*
 This package implements TWAMP protocol client and server.
 RFC 5357  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5357

 The client code was loosely based on https://github.com/tcaine/twamp
 Server code originated from https://github.com/vvidic/go-twamp

 The idea of this package is to have full server+client implementation
 And client/server code reuse
